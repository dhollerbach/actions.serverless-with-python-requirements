# Metrics

As part of the Serverless Insights feature we also include a set of pre-configured metrics and charts, including the following:

## Errors and Invocations

The errors and invocations chart shows error count trends and the aggregate number of invocations for a particular service for a selected time period. Click into any bar on the chart to see function specific metrics.

## Durations

The durations chart shows the aggregate duration times for all functions in a particular Service for a selected time period. Click into any point on the chart to see function specific metrics.
