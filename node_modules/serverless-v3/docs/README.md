# Serverless Framework Documentation

Develop, deploy, troubleshoot and secure your serverless applications with radically less overhead and cost by using the Serverless Framework. The Serverless Framework consists of an open source CLI and a hosted dashboard. Together, they provide you with full serverless application lifecycle management.

**Are you new to serverless application development?**

Sign up for our [hosted dashboard](https://app.serverless.com) (it’s free) and we’ll help deploy your first serverless app in minutes.

If you prefer to start on the CLI, use our [get started](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/) guide.

**If you are an experienced user of the Serverless Framework**

Our [hosted dashboard](https://app.serverless.com/) allows you to import existing projects. Track performance, troubleshoot, configure CI/CD and deployment policies, and get end-to-end serverless application lifecycle management.
